# Introduction

The Voten API is organized around REST. It can be used to build non-automated, high-quality apps and services that interact with Voten platform. Needless to say, the platform itself is [open-source](https://github.com/voten-co/voten/), meaning you can send PRs and open issues in case needed.

## Rate Limits:

There's a limit of 120 hits per minute; which is more than enough to create any kind of application. 

## What exactly can I build using the API?

We're already using this very same API for our web client, and we're about to start mobile apps on top of it. Thus there's pretty much a lot you can build with it.

However, if there's something you need that the current API does not satisfy, you may submit a request for it to [\#votendev](https://voten.co/c/votendev).
